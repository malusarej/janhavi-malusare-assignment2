**What were some challenges you faced while making this app?**
- Figuring out how to display the resized grid based on user input.
- Trying to figure out how to implement the heatmap component.
- Figuring out how react routing works to make a navbar and render everything correctly.

**Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make**
- I would implement all the extra credit features.
- I would add more effects and animations to make it dynamic and pleasing.
- Would research CSS libraries more in depth to use different effects.

**What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?**
- Reset grid should bring back initial grid size of 20x20.
- Input fields should use arrows to show dynamic change of the grid and submit button resets the game to fit those new parameters.
- Home page should be displayed first even if it's separate from app.

**How long did this assignment take to complete?**
- I spent around twenty hours doing this assignment.
